This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application that is designed to act as a testing playground for the [Meyda](https://meyda.js.org/) library.

After discovering the library, I got inspried to make it the backbone for my next project, and this repo is for tesing the library and how I can best utilize its features.

## Getting Started

First, clone/download the repo

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
